# 4. Matter vs. Antimatter 

### Description
**Positron** and **Negatron** are experimenting with a particle string consisting of '0's and '1's.
- **Positron** moves first.
- In each turn, a player must choose two **adjacent** particles that are **different** (one '0' and one '1') and annihilate (remove) them.
- After removal, the remaining particles snap together, potentially creating new adjacent pairs.
- The player who cannot find a "01" or "10" pair to remove loses.

Given the starting configuration, determine the winner.

### Input
- The first line contains $t$ (number of test cases).
- Each test case is a binary string $s$.

### Output
For each test case, print "Positron" if they win, otherwise "Negatron".

### Sample
**Input:**
```text
3
01
1111
0011
```

**Output:**

```
Positron
Negatron
Positron
```
