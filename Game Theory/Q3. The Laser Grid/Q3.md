# 3. The Laser Grid 

### Description
**Tron** and **Clu** are trapped in a digital grid formed by $n$ horizontal laser beams and $m$ vertical laser beams.
- The beams cross at "intersection points".
- On each turn, a player must hack one intersection point. Hacking an intersection permanently disables the **one horizontal beam** and the **one vertical beam** that pass through that point.
- **Tron** moves first.
- The player who cannot find an intact intersection to hack crashes and loses the game.

Determine who wins if both play optimally.

### Input
Two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 100$).

### Output
Print "Tron" if he wins, otherwise print "Clu".
