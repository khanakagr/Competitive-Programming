# 5. The Mirror Breaker 

### Description
**Gemini** and **Twin** are playing a game with a mystical string of runes (lowercase letters).
- **Gemini** moves first.
- On a turn, a player must find two **adjacent** runes that are **identical** (e.g., "rr") and shatter (delete) them.
- When runes are shattered, the remaining string connects. This might bring two other identical runes together (e.g., "abba" -> shatter "bb" -> "aa").
- The player who cannot find a pair to shatter loses.

Determine if **Gemini** (the first player) wins.

### Input
A single string $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

### Output
Print "Yes" if **Gemini** wins, otherwise print "No".

### Sample
**Input:**
`abba`
**Output:**
`Yes`
