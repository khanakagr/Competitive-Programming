# 2. The Ancient Scroll Hunt

### Description
**Indy** and **Lara** have found a line of $n$ ancient scrolls, each with a specific magical power value.
- **Indy** goes first.
- On each turn, a player can take either the **leftmost** scroll or the **rightmost** scroll from the line.
- Both treasure hunters are competitive and greedy: they will always choose the available scroll with the **highest** power value to add to their personal collection.
- The game ends when no scrolls are left.

Calculate the total power collected by Indy and Lara respectively.

### Input

- The second line contains $n$ distinct integers representing the power of the scrolls.
