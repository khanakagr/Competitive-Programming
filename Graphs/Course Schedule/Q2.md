# 2. Course Schedule

### Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` indicates that you **must** take course `b` first if you want to take course `a`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Input
- An integer **numCourses**
- A 2D array **prerequisites**

**Constraints:**
