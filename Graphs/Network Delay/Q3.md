# 3. Network Delay Time 

### Description
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the **minimum time** it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the nodes to receive the signal, return -1.

### Input
- A 2D array **times**
- An integer **n**
- An integer **k** (starting node)

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ times.length ≤ 6000
- 0 ≤ wi ≤ 100

---

### Output
Print the minimum time required or -1.
