# 4. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination 

### Description
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right. You are also given an integer `k` which is the maximum number of obstacles you can eliminate.

Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower right corner `(m-1, n-1)`.

### Input
- A 2D array **grid**
- An integer **k**

**Constraints:**
- m == grid.length, n == grid[i].length
- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ k ≤ m * n

---

### Output
Print the minimum steps or -1 if unreachable.
