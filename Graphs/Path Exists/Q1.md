# 1. Find if Path Exists in Graph (Easy)

### Description
There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. Given the edges and two vertices `source` and `destination`, determine if there is a **valid path** that exists between these two vertices.
---

### Input
- An integer **n** (number of vertices)
- A 2D array **edges** where `edges[i] = [u, v]`
- An integer **source**
- An integer **destination**

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10⁵
- 0 ≤ edges.length ≤ 2 * 10⁵
- source and destination are within [0, n-1]

---

### Output
Print `true` if a path exists, otherwise print `false`.

### Sample
**Input:**
3
[[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]]
0
2

**Output:**
true
