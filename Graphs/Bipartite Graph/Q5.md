# 2. Is Graph Bipartite? (Medium)

### Description
There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets $U$ and $V$ such that every edge in the graph connects a node in $U$ and a node in $V$.


---

### Input
- A 2D array **graph** representing the adjacency list.

**Constraints:**
- $n == graph.length$
- $1 \le n \le 100$
- $0 \le graph[u].length < n$

---

### Output
Print `true` if the graph is bipartite, otherwise `false`.

---

### Sample
**Input:**
[[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]

**Output:**
false
