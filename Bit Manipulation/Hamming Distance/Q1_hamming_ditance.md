# 1. Hamming Distance 

### Description
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers `x` and `y`, return the **Hamming distance** between them.

### Input
- Two integers **x** and **y**

**Constraints:**
- 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2³¹ - 1

---

### Output
Print a single integer — the number of bits that differ between the two inputs.

---

### Sample
**Input:**
1
4

**Note:** 1 is `(0 0 0 1)` and 4 is `(0 1 0 0)`. The bits differ at two positions.

**Output:**
2
