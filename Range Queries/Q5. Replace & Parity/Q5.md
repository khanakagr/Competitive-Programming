# 5. Replace & Parity 

**Problem**  
Priya has an integer array `a[1..n]`. She wants to answer queries of the form: *If we change all elements in the range `[l, r]` to value `k` (temporarily, queries are independent), will the total sum of the array become odd?* For each query output `YES` if the resulting whole-array sum is odd, otherwise `NO`.

Each query is independent: modifications do not persist to later queries.

**Input**  
- First line: integer `t` — number of test cases.  
Each test case:  
- Line 1: integers `n q`.  
- Line 2: `n` integers `a1 a2 ... an`.  
- Next `q` lines: `l r k`.

**Output**  
- For each `l r k` print `YES` or `NO` on its own line.

**Constraints**
- Sum of `n` across tests ≤ 2 * 10^5  
- Sum of `q` across tests ≤ 2 * 10^5  
- `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`  
- `|ai|, |k| ≤ 10^9`

**Example**
```

Input
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 4 2
1 5 1
3 3 10

Output
NO
YES
NO

```

**Explanation**  
- Query1: change indices 2..4 to 2 → array becomes [1,2,2,2,5], sum = 12 ⇒ even → NO  
- Query2: change 1..5 to 1 → sum = 5 ⇒ odd → YES  
- Query3: change only index 3 to 10 → sum = 1+2+10+4+5 = 22 ⇒ even → NO

**Notes / Hints**  
Compute initial sum S. For a query, the new sum = `S - (sum of a[l..r]) + (r-l+1)*k`. Use prefix sums to get `sum of a[l..r]` in O(1).
