# 3. Parcel Updates 

**Problem**  
Nina maintains records of parcels in a line. Initially the array `p[1..n]` is given. She receives `m` operations of two types:  
- `1 l r x` — add value `x` to **every element** in range `[l, r]`.  
- `2 i` — query and print the current value of `p[i]`.

Operations are online (each affects subsequent queries).

**Input**  
- First line: two integers `n m`.  
- Second line: `n` integers `p1 p2 ... pn`.  
- Next `m` lines: each is one operation of the two types described above.

**Output**  
- For each operation of type `2`, print the value of `p[i]` after applying all previous operations.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^5`  
- `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`  
- `1 ≤ i ≤ n`  
- `|pi|, |x| ≤ 10^9` (use 64-bit)

**Example**
```

Input
5 6
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 3 10
2 2
1 2 5 -2
2 3
2 5
2 1

Output
12
11
3
11

```

**Notes / Hints**  
Use a **difference array** + point prefix (or a Fenwick/BIT that supports range add & point query) for O(log n) updates and O(log n) queries.
