# 4. Festival Crowd 

**Problem**  
At a festival, spectators stand in positions 1..n. Each person has a badge number `b[i]`. Coach Arjun wants to know how many **distinct badge numbers** appear in several queried ranges `[l, r]`.

Given `q` offline queries, return the number of distinct integers in each range.

**Input**  
- First line: two integers `n q`.  
- Second line: `n` integers `b1 b2 ... bn`.  
- Next `q` lines: each contains `l r`.

**Output**  
- For each query, output the number of distinct badge numbers in the subarray `b[l..r]`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n, q ≤ 2 * 10^5`  
- `1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^9` (coordinate compress if needed)

**Example**
```

Input
7 4
1 2 1 3 2 2 4
1 3
2 5
3 7
1 7

Output
2
3
3
4

```

**Notes / Hints**  
This is a classic Mo’s algorithm problem (sqrt decomposition of queries) — good practice for offline range queries. Alternatively you can use last-occurrence + Fenwick if queries are sorted by right endpoint.
