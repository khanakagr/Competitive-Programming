# 2. The Watchtower 

**Problem**  
Ravi manages watchtowers placed along a road; each tower has a height `h[i]`. For safety analysis he needs to answer queries: for the inclusive range `[l, r]`, what is the **minimum height** among towers in that range? There are no updates — the array is static.

**Input**  
- First line: two integers `n q`.  
- Second line: `n` integers `h1 h2 ... hn`.  
- Next `q` lines: each has `l r` (1-based).

**Output**  
- For each query print a single integer — the minimum height in `[l, r]`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n, q ≤ 2 * 10^5`  
- `|hi| ≤ 10^9`

**Example**
```

Input
6 4
5 2 6 3 4 1
1 2
2 5
3 3
1 6

Output
2
2
6
1

```

**Notes / Hints**  
Use a sparse table (O(1) query after O(n log n) build) or a segment tree for fast queries.
