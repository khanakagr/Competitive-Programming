# 1. Riverbank Sums 

**Problem**  
Emma has an array of integers representing stones along a riverbank: `a[1..n]`. She will be given `q` queries. Each query asks for the **sum** of elements in a contiguous range `[l, r]`. The array is *static* (no updates).

Help Emma answer all queries quickly.

**Input**  
- First line: two integers `n q` — length of the array and number of queries.  
- Second line: `n` integers `a1 a2 ... an`.  
- Next `q` lines: each contains two integers `l r` (1-based, `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`).

**Output**  
- For each query print the sum of `a[l] + a[l+1] + ... + a[r]` on its own line.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n, q ≤ 2 * 10^5`  
- `|ai| ≤ 10^9` (sums fit in 64-bit)

**Example**
```

Input
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 3
2 4
3 5

Output
6
9
12

```

**Notes / Hints**  
Use prefix sums to answer each query in O(1) after O(n) preprocessing.
